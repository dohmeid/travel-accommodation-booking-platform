## :mantelpiece_clock: Project Management and Tracking
For the development process of TravelHub, I utilized **Linear.app**, a project management tool designed to help track tasks, deadlines, and overall progress. Below is the workflow overview:
1. Workspace Creation: I created a new workspace in Linear specifically for the TravelHub project.
2. Timeline Setup: I established the start and expected finish times for the application development.
3. Milestones Definition: Major milestones were defined along with deadlines for each. Breaking the project into manageable tasks simplifies tracking and management.
4. Development Process: I initiated the development by implementing the first milestone, followed by subsequent ones.
5. Task Management: Each new milestone was divided into multiple issues or 'todos,' which I implemented sequentially until the milestone was completed. <br>
Below is a snapshot of the workspace showing the project details and major milestones.
